Ugly Jamendo music app for your device of choice.

Fetches oggs through the jamendo API and plays them

To use: type to search and click the title of a song to play

DISCLAIMER:
I'm not responsible if your cat dies after using this software.
Also, how did your cat learn how to use a computer?

Also I don't own, nor do I have any affiliation with Jamendo.
All music streamed belongs to the author and not me
(unless by some miracle my music gets on there).

API KEY
There's a default API key in there - only use it for testing.
Go get your own at:
http://developer.jamendo.com/v3.0#obtain_client_id
I might make your browser save the last thing in there in future.

LICENCE:
Whatever man. Just don't sue me, got it?
